## üì∏ Project Overview

This project implements a compact dosimeter system, structured in the following stages:  
1. **Detection:** A Silicon Avalanche Photodiode (APD) detects ionizing radiation.  
2. **Analog front-end:** The APD signal is conditioned using a transimpedance amplifier (OPA657) and further stages.  
3. **Digitalization:** The conditioned signal is read by the **ADC of the ESP32-C3**, programmed in MicroPython.  
4. **Wireless communication:** Data is transmitted in real time via **Wi-Fi**.  
5. **Analysis:** Simulation and experimental data are analyzed using Python scripts.
